This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl programming: accessing an element in an array that is beyond the array's defined index.  The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error is particularly subtle because Perl doesn't always immediately throw an error. Instead, it might return undef, potentially leading to hard-to-debug issues later in the program.
